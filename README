The script are related to the behavior estimation method, described in the article:
``Game Theoretical Inference of Human Behaviour in Social Networks''.

The code is structured as follows:
- test folder: contains 4 different tests, 2 for the data-sets (Medici and Australian bank);
  and 2 for the complex network analysis (preferential attachment and small-world);
- Datasets folder: contains the 2 data-sets, and related setup files;
- complex_networks folder: contains the utilities to create prototypical complex networks;
- behavior_estimation_method folder: contains the scripts needed to perform the statistical
  analysis described as behavior estimation method in the paper.
- utilities folder: contains some utilities file, such as plot files.

We execute the code on Matlab R2018a. In order to perform some output operations, we 
use matlab2tikz available here: https://github.com/matlab2tikz/matlab2tikz. 
Moreover, in order to perform the polyhedra description, we use the software package called 
Multi-parametric Toolbox 3 available here: www.mpt3.org
We also provide the installation file: utilities/install_mpt3.m
